\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The aims of this project were to compare and contrast the structure and performance of a selection of recently published any-angle pathfinding algorithms.

\section*{Work Completed}
The pathfinding simulator allows a user to choose or create a map and specify any of the pathfinding algorithms to find a path through that map. The simulator displays the path found along with various statistics about that map. Statistics can be automatically generated for large volumes of maps using the simulator's API.\\

\noindent
Evaluation of the statistics produced by the simulator shows results consistent with the literature, and alternative implementation strategies are also compared. Discussion of the algorithms identifies shortcomings in common comparison metrics, and suggests possible optimisations for the algorithms.

\section*{Special Difficulties}
None.
